# 04 AUGUST - OVERGROWN TRAIL SECTIONS UPDATE FOR KM29-KM25
Hikers who recently travelled the section of trail from the Beach Access at [KM29] to Tsusiat Falls [KM25] report that it has been brushed by Ditidaht First Nation Guardians, but hikers should use caution as the excess brush is now on the trail making it hard to see the ground in some spots and also a bit slippery from the dead, dry salal leaves.

# 10 JULY - CAMP FIRE BAN
A camp fire ban is in effect as of Friday 12 July 2024 for the entire Province of BC. NO FIRES anywhere on the West Coast Trail are permitted. The fines are over $1000 per person at the campfire, regardless of who actually started it.
  
# 01 JULY - MULTIPLE LADDER RUNGS MISSING
Hikers have reported ladder rungs missing on several ladders along the trail but one ladder on the south side of Cullite Cove is missing multiple rungs with others held on by bits of rope. Use caution on ladders, especially when descending. 
  
# 01 MAY - OVERGROWN TRAIL SECTIONS
Two trail sections are likely still badly overgrown. Tsusiat Falls [KM25] to the Beach Access at [KM29] and Dare Beach [KM40] to Cribs Creek [KM41.5]. If you hike either of these sections please let us know the conditions.
