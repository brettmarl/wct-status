- Carmanah Creek cable car out of service. Carmanah Creek is flooding with the recent rains and the rope is off the pully on the south side making the cable car non-operational. Parks Canada expects to get it repaired soon but no timeline has been provided. If attempting to cross the creek use extreme caution. The safest option is to wait at Carmanah Creek camp on the north side or Bonilla Creek camp on the south side until at least tomorrow when the water levels should drop.

- Multiple hikers have reported a beached whale near KM26. Use extreme caution in the area as the carcass will attract predators (bears, wolves, and cougars).

# 01 MAY
- Two trail sections are likely still badly overgrown. Tsusiat Falls (KM25) to the Beach Access at KM29 and Dare Beach (KM40) to Cribs Creek (KM41.5) If you hike either of these sections please let us know the conditions.

- First Nation trail guardians have been hard at work for the past 3 weeks clearing the trail. All windfalls are cleared to KM25 but no reports of KM25-50 or KM50-75 have been received yet.

- Use extreme caution in wet conditions as all wooden surfaces get very slippery over the winter without all the foot traffic.
