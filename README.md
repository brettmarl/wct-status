# WEST COAST TRAIL OPENS MAY 1ST
The 2025 season officially begins on May 1st. A heartfelt thanks to the trail guardians and crews who will be performing pre-season maintenance to clear winter debris and ensure the trail is ready for hikers.

# CULLITE CAMP CAUTION
Parks Canada is advising hikers to exercise caution when considering Cullite as a campsite. The trail into the camp is washed out, and access is only possible via the creek bed. During heavy rains, Cullite Creek is prone to flash flooding, which could leave hikers stranded or force them into a dangerous wade back to the cable car. Those hiking in early or late season should be particularly cautious.

#  LIGHTSTATIONS CLOSED IN 2025
Both Carmanah and Pachena lightstations are closed to the public for the 2025 season until futher notice. Hikers must not attempt to enter the grounds. Violators may face charges under the Canada National Parks Act, with a maximum penalty of $25,000.
