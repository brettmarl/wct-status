Fires are currently banned until futher notice. Use of campstoves is OK. 

#Water Conditions

The source for the Black River is Black Lake - a few kilometers inland. The river is reported to be high in minerals, and possibly tannins, so best avoided. It is also a bit treacherous to get down to the water level under the bridge too. If you can not make it the 12km to Michigan for water there are a couple of other small streams along the way that may have good water, or you can ask at Pachena Pt as we have an outstanding water source here. Note that there is no water available in Pachena Bay at the trailhead - the first source is Clonard Creek near KM1, unless you are staying in the Pachena Bay campground where you can fill up before you start.

All the creeks and Rivers along the West Coast Trail are running very low right now due to the unusually dry conditions, but they are all running and the majority have good, if not great water. Only the Black River, Cheewhat River, and Adrenaline Creek are to be avoided.

#Wildlife
