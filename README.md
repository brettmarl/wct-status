# HIGH RIVER LEVELS
Due to the recent rains the rivers are running with more water again. Crossing the Walbran can be tricky and the gravel bar that had formed at the Klanawa River mouth is now gone so the cable car is required.

# OVERGROWN TRAIL SECTIONS - July 26
Reports from hikers indicate that the trail is badly overgrown at two points on the trail: Dare Beach (KM40) to Cribs Creek (KM41.5) and Tsusiat Falls (KM25) to the Beach Access at KM29. The section from Tsusiat Falls to Hole in the Wall is reported to be extremely bad.

# BEARS NEAR MICHIGAN - July 26
Three different groups of hikers reported 3 different bear sightings between KM11 (top of th hill) and Michigan Creek (KM12.2). When hiking in this area make lots of noise and try to travel in groups.

# DARLING RIVER WASP NEST - July 19
Multiple hikers have reported being stung by wasps near the waterfall at the Darling River. A nest is possibly located in a pile of old driftwood upstream near the waterfall. Use caution.

# WEST COAST FOG - July 17

# WILDLIFE - July 16
Bears have been frequently reported in the following areas: Pachena Bay to Michigan Creek, Tsusiat Falls to Nitinaht Narrows, and Walbran Creek. Please do not leave garbage at campsites or in bear bins as this attracts bears and frequent bear encounters may result in campsite closures.

Whales have been seen frequently at the Sealion Rocks viewpoint (KM9.5) and between Michigan Creek and Tsusiat Falls. 

# WATER SOURCES - July 15
All creeks and rivers are running very low due to unusually dry conditions, but water is still available at major creeks and campsites. The Black River (KM8), Cheewhat River(KM36), and Adrenaline Creek (KM55) should be avoided due to their bad taste. A limited amount of filtered water may be available at the Pachena Point Lightstation. Please ask the Lightkeepers if you need water.
