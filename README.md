# 24 MAY CARMANAH CREEK UPDATE
- Carmanah Creek cable car may be out of service due to recent issues with the line coming off the pulley on the south tower. Currently it is working. If Carmanah Creek floods during rainy weather, and the cable car is out of service, it many be extremely dangerous to attempt to cross the creek and hikers should be prepared to wait until water levels are lower. Parks Canada is aware of the issue and expects to get it repaired soon. 

# 05 MAY
- Multiple hikers have reported a beached whale near KM26. Use extreme caution in the area as the carcass will attract predators (bears, wolves, and cougars).

# 01 MAY
- Two trail sections are likely still badly overgrown. Tsusiat Falls (KM25) to the Beach Access at KM29 and Dare Beach (KM40) to Cribs Creek (KM41.5) If you hike either of these sections please let us know the conditions.

- First Nation trail guardians have been hard at work for the past 3 weeks clearing the trail. All windfalls are cleared to KM25 but no reports of KM25-50 or KM50-75 have been received yet.

- Use extreme caution in wet conditions as all wooden surfaces get very slippery over the winter without all the foot traffic.
