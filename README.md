# CAMPFIRE BAN
Effective Thursday, July 17 at 12:00 PM PST, all campfires are prohibited on the West Coast Trail and throughout other coastal regions in BC. This ban will likely remain in effect for the rest of the hiking season.

If you encounter hikers with campfires after this date, kindly let them know about the banâ€”they may have started their hike before the restriction was announced.

# WALBRAN CABLE CAR OPEN 
Walbran Cable Car route is open for hikers. The ladder system on the north side that was damaged by winter storms has been replaced as of June 13th.


# BEAR IN AREA - TSUSIAT FALLS CAMPSITE
Parks Canada issued a BEAR in AREA WARNING for Tsusiat Falls Camp & surrounding area. 

Recent reports from hikers indicate that two bears are frequenting this area. The behaviour includes highly habituated (indifferent to humans) and food seeking (seeking opportunities to gain access to human food/garbage). Parks is asking all hikers aid in reducing the risk of negative human-bear interactions by these extra precautions:

To reduce risk, hikers must be extra vigilant in this area. Store all food, garbage, and scented items securely in bear bins or hung properlyâ€”not just at night, but also during the day if a bear has been seen nearby. Never leave packs, snacks, or trash unattended. If a bear is observed, put attractants away immediately, group together, make noise, and prepare deterrents like bear spray or air horns. Give the bear plenty of space and never approach. Always sleep in a tent, not in the open.





# BEAR IN AREA - PACHENA-DARLING
Parks Canada has issued a BEAR in AREA WARNING for the north end, from Pachena Bay through to Darling River. This includes the immediate areas around the Pachena Bay Orientation Center, the beach route to Clonard Creek, and the West Coast Trail up to Darling River, including designated camping areas at Michigan and Darling.

Reports from hikers and staff indicate that there are multiple bears along this stretch, including sows with cubs frequently using this area. Human-bear interactions have occurred at multiple locations along this stretch of trail, including close to campsites. 
# CULLITE CAMP CAUTION
Parks Canada is advising hikers to exercise caution when considering Cullite as a campsite. The trail into the camp is washed out, and access is only possible via the creek bed. During heavy rains, Cullite Creek is prone to flash flooding, which could leave hikers stranded or force them into a dangerous wade back to the cable car. Those hiking in early or late season should be particularly cautious.

#  LIGHTSTATIONS CLOSED IN 2025
Both Carmanah and Pachena lightstations are closed to the public for the 2025 season until futher notice. Hikers must not attempt to enter the grounds. Violators may face charges under the Canada National Parks Act, with a maximum penalty of $25,000.
