# BEAR IN AREA - TSUSIAT FALLS CAMPSITE
Parks Canada issued a BEAR in AREA WARNING for Tsusiat Falls Camp & surrounding area. 

Recent reports from hikers indicate that two bears are frequenting this area. The behaviour includes highly habituated (indifferent to humans) and food seeking (seeking opportunities to gain access to human food/garbage). Parks is asking all hikers aid in reducing the risk of negative human-bear interactions by these extra precautions:

To reduce risk, hikers must be extra vigilant in this area. Store all food, garbage, and scented items securely in bear bins or hung properly—not just at night, but also during the day if a bear has been seen nearby. Never leave packs, snacks, or trash unattended. If a bear is observed, put attractants away immediately, group together, make noise, and prepare deterrents like bear spray or air horns. Give the bear plenty of space and never approach. Always sleep in a tent, not in the open.





# BEAR IN AREA - PACHENA-DARLING
Parks Canada has issued a BEAR in AREA WARNING for the north end, from Pachena Bay through to Darling River. This includes the immediate areas around the Pachena Bay Orientation Center, the beach route to Clonard Creek, and the West Coast Trail up to Darling River, including designated camping areas at Michigan and Darling.

Reports from hikers and staff indicate that there are multiple bears along this stretch, including sows with cubs frequently using this area. Human-bear interactions have occurred at multiple locations along this stretch of trail, including close to campsites. 

# WALBRAN CABLE CAR CLOSED
*map!53* – Walbran Creek North side – ladder system damaged by windfall. 
The forest section from 51 km (near Vancouver Point) to South of Walbran Creek including the Walbran Creek Cable Car is closed. The beach route between Vancouver Point and Walbran Creek South is your only option for this section of the trail, but this beach route is heavily TIDE DEPENDENT. You will also have to wade across Walbran Creek and do so only when it is safe to do so. The Walbran Creek cable car is closed and there is no access to the beach from the north side of Walbran Creek.

As a result, your hike may take longer than expected and will require extra planning and preparation. Parks Canada suggests you plan, at a minimum, 2 days for contingency especially if rains cause the Walbran Creek to swell. 

# CULLITE CAMP CAUTION
Parks Canada is advising hikers to exercise caution when considering Cullite as a campsite. The trail into the camp is washed out, and access is only possible via the creek bed. During heavy rains, Cullite Creek is prone to flash flooding, which could leave hikers stranded or force them into a dangerous wade back to the cable car. Those hiking in early or late season should be particularly cautious.

#  LIGHTSTATIONS CLOSED IN 2025
Both Carmanah and Pachena lightstations are closed to the public for the 2025 season until futher notice. Hikers must not attempt to enter the grounds. Violators may face charges under the Canada National Parks Act, with a maximum penalty of $25,000.
