# 2026 TRAIL RESERVATIONS
Each year, Parks Canada opens reservations on a specific date in January, known as reservation day. This is when thousands of hikers all try to book permits at the same time. The most popular dates often sell out within minutes. Parks Canada usually announces the exact reservation day by early January — for 2026, it will likely fall around January 20th.
