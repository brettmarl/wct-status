See our 2024 TIDE & PLANNING CALENDAR on the WCT Facebook page 10 OCTOBER 2023 to select your dates and ensure Owen Point is passable! (Look in the FILES section)

Watch for 2024 reservations to open - usually in the first week of January. Good Luck!

For 2024 - two trail sections are confirmed to remain badly overgrown. Tsusiat Falls (KM25) to the Beach Access at KM29 and Dare Beach (KM40) to Cribs Creek (KM41.5)
