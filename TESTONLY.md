# EARLY SEASON TRAIL DAMAGE
Storm damage over the winter that has caused some major damage on the south end of the trail. Parks Canada and First Nations Trail Guardians are working hard to repair the damage. 

The following advisories are in place:

53 km ‚Äì Walbran Creek North side ‚Äì ladder system damaged by windfall. The forest section from 51 km (near Vancouver Point) to South of Walbran Creek including the Walbran Creek Cable Car is closed. The beach route between Vancouver Point and Walbran Creek South is your only option for this section of the trail, but this beach route is heavily TIDE DEPENDENT. You will also have to wade across Walbran Creek and do so only when it is safe to do so. The Walbran Creek cable car is closed and there is no access to the beach from the north side of Walbran Creek.

58 km Cullite Creek South side ‚Äì landslide compromised the ladder system, re-route and ropes in place and crew on site.

59 km Sandstone Creek North Side ‚Äì washout compromised the ladder system, re-route and ropes in place and crew on site.

62 km South of Camper Creek ‚Äì landslide, re-route in place

69 km ‚Äì bridge closed in area, re-route is in place.

As a result, your hike will likely take longer than expected and will require extra planning and preparation. We suggest you plan, at a minimum, 2 days for contingency especially if rains cause the Walbran Creek to swell. As we continue to assess the trail, conditions may change. 


# CULLITE CAMP CAUTION
Parks Canada is advising hikers to exercise caution when considering Cullite as a campsite. The trail into the camp is washed out, and access is only possible via the creek bed. During heavy rains, Cullite Creek is prone to flash flooding, which could leave hikers stranded or force them into a dangerous wade back to the cable car. Those hiking in early or late season should be particularly cautious.

#  LIGHTSTATIONS CLOSED IN 2025
Both Carmanah and Pachena lightstations are closed to the public for the 2025 season until futher notice. Hikers must not attempt to enter the grounds. Violators may face charges under the Canada National Parks Act, with a maximum penalty of $25,000.
