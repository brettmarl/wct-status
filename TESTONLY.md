# EARLY SEASON TRAIL DAMAGE
Parks Canada has been working to address storm damage from last winter that has caused some major damage on the south end of the trail. The following advisories are in place:

🪜 53 km – Walbran Creek (North Side)
Issue: Ladder system damaged by windfall.

Closure: Forest section from 51 km (near Vancouver Point) to south of Walbran Creek is closed, including the Walbran Creek Cable Car.

Alternative: Beach route between Vancouver Point and Walbran Creek South is TIDE DEPENDENT and requires wading across Walbran Creek. Only attempt when safe.

Note: No beach access from the north side of Walbran Creek due to cable car closure.

Issue: Landslide has compromised the ladder system.

Solution: Re-route and ropes are in place; crew is on site.

# CULLITE CAMP CAUTION
Parks Canada is advising hikers to exercise caution when considering Cullite as a campsite. The trail into the camp is washed out, and access is only possible via the creek bed. During heavy rains, Cullite Creek is prone to flash flooding, which could leave hikers stranded or force them into a dangerous wade back to the cable car. Those hiking in early or late season should be particularly cautious.

#  LIGHTSTATIONS CLOSED IN 2025
Both Carmanah and Pachena lightstations are closed to the public for the 2025 season until futher notice. Hikers must not attempt to enter the grounds. Violators may face charges under the Canada National Parks Act, with a maximum penalty of $25,000.
