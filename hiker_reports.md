Heat wave! Very sunny, dry, and hot conditions increasing likelihood of heat illnesses like heat syncope, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. Prolonged sun exposure and heavy exercise also increasing risk of sunburn and dehydration. Lots of shady breaks for resting and hydrating are essential. MB

# 11 JULY - LADDER  
Location: Cullite area   
The ladder missing multiple runs and the ones remaining being loose. I am 5’2 and it was a struggle to pull myself up with a heavy pack. I did it but I am also of average fitness. For elderly or children, this is a major concern. I hope writing this gets the issue addressed before someone gets hurt

The fresh water source north of the Cheewhat River is a ditch with a little very brown water. Cannot be relied upon in these conditions. 

# 08 MAY - TRAIL CONDITION  
Location: Dare Point  
On Sat. 4 May, we hiked nobo around Dare point on the cliff-top trail because the tide was high. Although the trail was cleared in parts, the Salal was very thick and at time we were just pushing through it and calling out to alert any bears. I’m at least one place, the cliff soil had slumped and the bushes on the seaward side of the trail were gone, leaving a lot of exposure and the risk of falling in slippery conditions. 
The beach access points at 38+ km were treacherous in the damp conditions. We stayed on the trail until we could access the sandy beach.
