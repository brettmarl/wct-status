## 12 JULY - OTHER
Location: Klanawa

It’s an easy ford at Klanawa river, depending on tide, if you want to skip the cable car. Gravel bar has built up such that it is an easy ford or even a dry ford of the river at medium to high tides.  Best ford is near high tide line at beach.

## 03 JUNE - TRAIL CONDITION
Location: 12

Michigan Mud Slide! Significant mud slide obstacle under busted bridge with limited options to avoid getting right into it. High route is on awkward angled terrain and resulted in slips and knee to waist mud. Low route is a busted section of super slick off camber bridge deck and requires some sketchy moves. Tread carefully! MB
